# connect-kotlin-server

Serve the [Connect protocol](https://connectrpc.com/docs/protocol) — plus gRPC-Web
and Connect streaming — **natively from the JVM**, directly on top of your existing
`grpc-java` services. No sidecar, no Go transcoding proxy.

📖 **Documentation:** **<https://cgardev.github.io/connect-kotlin-server/>** — getting started,
architecture, protocols, Spring Boot, configuration, error handling and API reference.
(Sources in [`docs/`](docs/), an Astro Starlight site.)

## Why

[`connect-kotlin`](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-kotlin) is **client-only** —
there is no server-side Connect implementation for Kotlin/Java. The common workaround
is to run a separate Go proxy (e.g. [Vanguard](https://github.com/connectrpc/vanguard-go))
in front of a gRPC backend to transcode Connect/gRPC-Web into gRPC.

`connect-kotlin-server` removes that hop: it hosts your `io.grpc.BindableService`s on an
**in-process gRPC channel** and serves them over the Connect protocols through an
**embedded Netty server**, invoking your handlers in the same JVM.

## Features

- **Protocols:** Connect (unary, non-enveloped), Connect streaming, and gRPC-Web.
- **Codecs:** Protobuf binary (`application/proto`) and Protobuf-JSON (`application/json`).
- **Transport:** embedded Netty HTTP/1.1; requests run on virtual threads off the event
  loop, server-streaming is delivered via chunked transfer.
- **Error model:** the full Connect error JSON (`code` / `message` / `details`), gRPC-Web
  trailers, and Connect end-of-stream — mapped from `io.grpc.Status`, verified against the
  `connect-go` reference.
- **Extras:** `GET` for idempotent (`NO_SIDE_EFFECTS`) unary methods, gzip, permissive CORS
  for browser clients, request metadata ↔ gRPC `Metadata`, and a liveness probe.
- **No framework lock-in:** the core library has **zero dependency on Spring or the Servlet
  API**. The only Spring code lives in the example app.

## Requirements

- JDK 24+
- gRPC services generated with `grpc-java` (any `BindableService`)

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are **no published releases yet**. While the project is in alpha, it is
> versioned **by commit** — depend on a specific commit and treat every commit as
> potentially breaking (see [Versioning & compatibility](#versioning--compatibility)).

Pull a specific commit through [JitPack](https://jitpack.io):

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
}

dependencies {
    // Replace <commit> with the exact short commit SHA you want to pin to.
    implementation("com.github.cgardev:connect-kotlin-server:<commit>")
}
```

Or build it locally and depend on the snapshot:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cgardev/connect-kotlin-server.git
cd connect-kotlin-server && ./gradlew :project:lib-connect-server:publishToMavenLocal
# then add mavenLocal() and io.github.cgardev:connect-kotlin-server:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

## Quick start

`ConnectServer` is the framework-agnostic entry point. Hand it your services, start it,
and it serves them over Connect/gRPC-Web:

```kotlin
import io.github.cgardev.library.connect.ConnectServer
import io.github.cgardev.library.connect.config.ConnectServerConfig

fun main() {
    val server = ConnectServer(
        services = listOf(EchoService()),                 // any io.grpc.BindableService
        config = ConnectServerConfig(port = 8080),
    )
    server.start()                                         // binds Netty, hosts the in-process gRPC channel
    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(Thread { server.close() })
}
```

### With Spring Boot

The Spring support is split into two modules, following Spring's own `*-autoconfigure`
convention — pick the one that matches how much wiring you want:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Zero wiring: auto-configures the server and registers its SmartLifecycle.
    implementation("io.github.cgardev:connect-kotlin-server-spring-boot-autoconfigure:<commit>")

    // — or — just the Spring components (ConnectServerLifecycle, ConnectServerProperties),
    // for when you want to declare the beans yourself:
    // implementation("io.github.cgardev:connect-kotlin-server-spring:<commit>")
}
```

With the auto-configuration starter you write **no wiring at all**: it builds the server
from your beans and manages it through a Spring `SmartLifecycle` (started with the context,
shut down gracefully on close). The Connect server brings its own Netty transport, so the
application needs no servlet container (`spring.main.web-application-type=none`).

```kotlin
@Component
class EchoService : EchoServiceGrpc.EchoServiceImplBase() { /* ... */ }
```

Any `BindableService` bean is discovered and served; `ServerInterceptor` beans are applied
to the in-process pipeline, exactly as a real gRPC server would. Everything is tunable under
the `connect.server.*` properties (`port`, `cors.*`, `compress-min-bytes`, …).

For a non-Spring application, build a [`ConnectServer`](#quick-start) directly as shown above.

## Trying the example

The `:project:app-server-spring` module exposes a demo `EchoService`
(`cgardev.example.v1.EchoService`):

```bash
./gradlew :project:app-server-spring:bootRun        # serves on :8080

# Connect unary, JSON
curl -X POST localhost:8080/cgardev.example.v1.EchoService/Echo \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"message":"hi"}'
# => {"message":"echo: hi"}

# Idempotent unary over GET
curl 'localhost:8080/cgardev.example.v1.EchoService/GetServerInfo?encoding=json&message=%7B%7D'
# => {"name":"connect-kotlin-server","version":"0.1.0"}
```

## Protocol support

| RPC type           | Connect | gRPC-Web | Connect streaming |
|--------------------|:-------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|
| Unary              |   ✅    |    ✅    |        ✅         |
| Server streaming   |   —     |    ✅    |        ✅         |
| Client / bidi      |   —     |    —     |        —          |

`GET` is supported for unary methods marked `idempotency_level = NO_SIDE_EFFECTS`.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build      # compile + test every module
```

The JVM tests in `app-server-spring` already drive the server over Connect, Connect
streaming and gRPC-Web. In addition, `tools/e2e-connect-web` is an end-to-end suite that
hits a running instance with the real [`@connectrpc/connect-web`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@connectrpc/connect-web)
client — the same library a browser uses — across both protocols and both the proto-binary
and JSON encodings. It builds and launches the server itself:

```bash
cd tools/e2e-connect-web && pnpm install && pnpm test
```

## Project layout

```
project/lib-connect-server/                          The core library. Spring-free, Servlet-free.
project/lib-connect-server-spring/                   Spring components: SmartLifecycle + properties.
project/lib-connect-server-spring-boot-autoconfigure/ Auto-configuration starter (depends on the above).
project/app-server-spring/                           Runnable example: a demo service served over Connect.
build-logic/                                         Gradle convention plugins.
```

## Versioning & compatibility

During alpha there are **no published releases and no version numbers** — the commit
**is** the version. Pin your dependency to an exact commit and upgrade deliberately:

- **No compatibility is guaranteed.** Source, binary and wire behaviour may change between
  any two commits, without deprecation cycles or migration notes.
- The Gradle version stays at `0.0.0-SNAPSHOT`; it is not a release.
- Once the API settles, this project will adopt semantic versioning and tagged releases.

## Publishing

There are no tagged releases yet, so consumers use JitPack by commit (see
[Installation](#installation)); JitPack builds the requested commit per
[`jitpack.yml`](jitpack.yml).

The build is also set up to publish via `maven-publish` once releases begin: to GitHub
Packages out of the box (CI uses the repository `GITHUB_TOKEN`), or to Maven Central under
the `io.github.cgardev` group — whose namespace is verified by proving ownership of the
`cgardev` GitHub account through the Sonatype Central Portal (no custom domain), plus a GPG
signing key via the `SIGNING_KEY` / `SIGNING_PASSWORD` environment variables.
See [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](.github/workflows/publish.yml).
